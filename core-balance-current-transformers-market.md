<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Core Balance Current Transformers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Split Type</li><li>Through Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Core balance current transformers are used for measurement and protection of electrical systems. They can be classified into two types: split type and through type. </p><p>Split type current transformers have a core that can be split into two parts. The primary conductor is passed through the center of the core for measuring the current. Split type transformers are commonly used for retrofit applications.</p><p>Through type current transformers have a solid and continuous core. The primary conductor is passed through a hole or window in the core. Through type transformers are commonly used in new installations where the primary conductor can be easily threaded through the core.</p></p>
