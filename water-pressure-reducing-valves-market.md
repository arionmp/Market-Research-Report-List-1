<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Water Pressure Reducing Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Acting Type</li><li>Pilot Operated Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Water pressure reducing valves are devices used in plumbing systems to regulate the flow and pressure of water. Direct acting type valves work by directly adjusting the valve opening in response to changes in downstream pressure. They are suitable for applications with low flow rates. Pilot operated type valves, on the other hand, use a diaphragm to control the valve opening. This type is suitable for high-flow applications and offers greater precision in pressure regulation. Both types are essential in maintaining optimal water pressure and preventing damage to plumbing systems.</p></p>
