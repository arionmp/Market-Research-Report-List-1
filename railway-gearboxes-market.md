<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Railway Gearboxes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Longitudinal Drive</li><li>Transversal Drive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Railway gearboxes are typically classified into two main types based on their drive orientation - longitudinal drive and transversal drive. Longitudinal drive gearboxes are designed to transmit power from the engine to the wheels along the length of the train. They are commonly used in locomotives and high-speed trains. On the other hand, transversal drive gearboxes are used in trains where power is transmitted from the engine to the wheels perpendicular to the train's length. These gearboxes are generally found in metro trains and light rail systems.</p></p>
