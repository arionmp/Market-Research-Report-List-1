<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hand-held Veterinary Refractometers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Optical Refractometers</li><li>Digital Refractometers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hand-held veterinary refractometers market includes two main types: optical refractometers and digital refractometers. Optical refractometers measure the refractive index of a liquid sample by using a prism and determining the angle at which light is bent when passing through the sample. Digital refractometers, on the other hand, provide a digital reading of the refractive index by using sensors to measure the light passing through the sample. Both types of refractometers are used in veterinary medicine to analyze the concentration of certain substances, such as urine specific gravity, which can indicate health conditions in animals.</p></p>
