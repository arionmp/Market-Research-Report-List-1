<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Metal Pancreatic & Biliary Stent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Covered Metal Stent</li><li>Uncovered Metal Stent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The metal pancreatic and biliary stent market includes two major types: covered metal stents and uncovered metal stents. Covered metal stents are designed with an outer layer that prevents tissue ingrowth, reducing the risk of stent blockage. They work best for patients with benign pancreatic and biliary strictures. On the other hand, uncovered metal stents lack an outer layer and are often used for patients with malignant strictures. They provide optimal drainage but may incur tissue ingrowth, leading to stent blockage.</p></p>
