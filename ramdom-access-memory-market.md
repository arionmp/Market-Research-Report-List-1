<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ramdom Access Memory Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>DRAM</li><li>ROM</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Random Access Memory (RAM) is a crucial component in computers and other electronic devices, allowing data to be stored and retrieved quickly. There are two main types of RAM: Dynamic RAM (DRAM) and Read-Only Memory (ROM). DRAM is volatile memory that needs constant refreshing to retain data, making it faster but more power-consuming. On the other hand, ROM is non-volatile memory that retains data even when the power is turned off, typically used to store permanent instructions and firmware in electronic devices. These RAM types play distinct roles in the functioning of modern technology.</p></p>
