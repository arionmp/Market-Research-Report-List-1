<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Portable Abrasive Blasters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pressure</li><li>Siphon</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Portable abrasive blasters are devices used for surface preparation and cleaning purposes. There are two main types in the market: pressure and siphon blasters. Pressure blasters operate by using compressed air to create pressure inside the abrasive tank, forcing the abrasives out through a nozzle. They are known for their high efficiency and versatility. On the other hand, siphon blasters work by using air to create suction, pulling the abrasives into a mixing chamber and then out through the nozzle. They are typically less efficient but more affordable than pressure blasters.</p></p>
