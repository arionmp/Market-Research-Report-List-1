<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Handheld Ultrasonic Flow Meter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Clamp</li><li>Clip-on</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Handheld ultrasonic flow meter market types mainly consist of clamp-on and clip-on meters. Clamp-on flow meters are attached to the outside of the pipe, measuring flow by sending ultrasonic waves through the pipe wall. They are non-intrusive and do not require pipe modification. On the other hand, clip-on flow meters are designed to be clamped directly onto the pipe, making them more portable and suitable for temporary measurements. Both types provide accurate and convenient flow measurements without disrupting the flow process.</p></p>
