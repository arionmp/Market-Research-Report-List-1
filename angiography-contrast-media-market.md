<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Angiography Contrast Media Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Organic Iodine Molecules Contrast</li><li>Gadolinium Contrast</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Angiography contrast media consists of two main types: organic iodine molecules contrast and gadolinium contrast. Organic iodine molecules contrast is commonly used in X-ray imaging and provides excellent visualization of blood vessels. It is non-toxic and has low risk of allergic reactions. On the other hand, gadolinium contrast is used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and enables enhanced images of blood vessels, organs, and tissues. Gadolinium contrast carries a higher risk of adverse reactions, particularly in patients with impaired kidney function.</p></p>
