<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Knee Prosthesis Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bone Cement Fixation Prosthesis</li><li>Biological Fixation Prosthesis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Knee prosthesis refers to artificial implants used to replace a damaged knee joint. There are two main types: bone cement fixation prosthesis and biological fixation prosthesis. The bone cement fixation prosthesis involves using a special cement to fix the prosthesis to the existing bones. On the other hand, the biological fixation prosthesis involves using materials that allow the patient's own bone to grow into the prosthesis, creating a natural bond. These different types cater to different patients, depending on their individual needs and conditions.</p></p>
