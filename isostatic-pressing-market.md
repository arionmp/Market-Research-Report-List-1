<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Isostatic Pressing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Bag Pressing</li><li>Dry Bag Pressing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Isostatic pressing is a manufacturing technique used in the production of ceramic and metal powders. Wet bag pressing involves placing the ceramic or metal powder in a flexible bag filled with liquid, then subjecting it to high pressure from all sides. This process helps to improve the density and uniformity of the final product. Dry bag pressing, on the other hand, involves using a rigid container instead of a flexible bag, and the pressure is applied without the presence of any liquid. This method is commonly used when the material being pressed is sensitive to moisture.</p></p>
