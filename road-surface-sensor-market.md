<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Road Surface Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active</li><li>Passive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Road surface sensors are devices used to monitor and collect data about the condition and characteristics of roads. Active sensors emit their own energy, like radar or lasers, and measure the reflection or absorption to identify road conditions. This type of sensor provides real-time data and is useful for measuring depth and texture of the road surface. In contrast, passive sensors rely on external sources of energy, like sunlight or vehicle headlights, and detect changes in the reflected energy. This type of sensor is typically used for monitoring temperature, ice formation, and tire traction on the road surface.</p></p>
