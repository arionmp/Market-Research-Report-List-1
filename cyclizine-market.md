Several factors are contributing to the increasing demand for cyclizine. One of the key drivers is the rising prevalence of motion sickness among individuals, particularly during travel. As travel and tourism continue to grow globally, the demand for motion sickness medications like cyclizine is also on the rise.</p><p>Furthermore, the use of cyclizine in the management of nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy and radiotherapy is also boosting the market growth. As cancer cases increase, the demand for effective antiemetics like cyclizine is expected to rise significantly.</p><p>In addition, the growing incidence of post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is further propelling the demand for cyclizine. PONV is a common complication after surgery, and medications like cyclizine are prescribed to prevent or treat these symptoms.</p><p>Moreover, the shift towards non-drowsy or less sedating antihistamines is driving the demand for cyclizine, as it is known to have comparatively lower sedative effects. This trend is particularly observed in the developed regions where consumers prefer medications that do not cause significant drowsiness or impair their daily activities.</p><p>Overall, the cyclizine market is expected to witness steady growth in the coming years due to the increasing prevalence of motion sickness, rising cancer cases, and growing demand for non-drowsy antiemetics. However, strict regulations and side effects associated with cyclizine may hinder market growth to some extent.</p></p>
