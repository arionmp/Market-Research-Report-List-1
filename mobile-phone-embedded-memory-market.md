<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mobile Phone Embedded Memory Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Volatile</li><li>Non-Volatile</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The mobile phone embedded memory market consists of two types: volatile and non-volatile memory. Volatile memory requires a constant power supply to retain stored data, as it quickly loses its data when power is turned off. Non-volatile memory, on the other hand, retains data even when power is disconnected. This means that non-volatile memory is able to retain stored information even during power outages or device shutdowns. Both types are essential for different functions in mobile phones, ensuring smooth operation and data integrity.</p></p>
