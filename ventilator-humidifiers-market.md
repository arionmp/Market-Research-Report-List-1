<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ventilator Humidifiers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bubble Humidifiers</li><li>Electronic Humidifiers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ventilator humidifiers are devices used in medical settings to provide moisture to patients who require mechanical ventilation. Bubble humidifiers work by bubbling oxygen or air through a water chamber, increasing humidity levels before the air reaches the patient. Electronic humidifiers, on the other hand, use advanced technology to deliver precise humidity levels by electronically controlling the water vapor output. Both types enhance patient comfort and can help prevent complications associated with dry air.</p></p>
