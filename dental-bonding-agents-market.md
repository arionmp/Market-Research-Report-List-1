<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dental Bonding Agents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Total-etch System</li><li>Self-etch System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dental bonding agents are used in dentistry to adhere restorative materials, such as dental composites, to the natural tooth structure. The Total-etch bonding system requires the application of etchant to the tooth surface, followed by the bonding agent. This system provides high bond strength but requires multiple steps. In contrast, the Self-etch bonding system combines the etching and bonding steps into one, simplifying the process. Although it offers lower bond strength than the Total-etch system, it is more convenient and time-saving for dental practitioners.</p></p>
