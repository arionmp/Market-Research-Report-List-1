<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Alzheimer’s Therapeutics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Donepezil</li><li>Memantine</li><li>Rivastigmine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Alzheimer's therapeutics market consists of three main types: Donepezil, Memantine, and Rivastigmine. Donepezil is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that helps improve memory and cognition in Alzheimer's patients. Memantine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, regulates the activity of glutamate, a neurotransmitter involved in learning and memory. It can reduce symptoms such as confusion and memory loss. Rivastigmine is another acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that increases the levels of neurotransmitters in the brain, improving cognitive function. These medications aim to alleviate the cognitive decline and improve the quality of life for Alzheimer's patients.</p></p>
