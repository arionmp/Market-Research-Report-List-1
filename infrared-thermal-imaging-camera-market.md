<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Infrared Thermal Imaging Camera Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cooled Type</li><li>Uncooled Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The infrared thermal imaging camera market can be divided into two types: cooled type and uncooled type. Cooled type cameras use a cooling mechanism, typically based on liquid nitrogen or Stirling cooler technology, to maintain the camera's detector at a very low temperature. This ensures higher sensitivity and better image resolution, making them ideal for applications requiring high performance. On the other hand, uncooled type cameras do not require any cooling mechanism and operate at room temperature. Although they have lower sensitivity and resolution, they are more cost-effective and suitable for applications where performance is less critical.</p></p>
