<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aluminium-extruded Products Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mill-Finished</li><li>Anodized</li><li>Powder-Coated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aluminium-extruded products can be categorized into three main types based on their finishing: Mill-Finished, Anodized, and Powder-Coated. Mill-Finished products have a smooth, matte surface directly from the extrusion process. Anodized products undergo an electrolytic process to create a durable and corrosion-resistant finish in various colors. Powder-Coated products are coated with a dry powder that is then heated to form a hard finish that is resistant to chipping, scratching, and fading. Each type offers different aesthetic and functional benefits for various applications.</p></p>
